-- BOOK 3 chapter 1 PRACTICE -- Update Operations
-- This chapter covers writing UPDATE statements for modifying data.
-- The UPDATE statement is used to edit existing records in a table. First you will need to provide the table name, then use the SET clause to assign the values to the columns you wish to update.
-- You will likely need to add a WHERE clause to your statement to specify which records to update. If WHERE is not included then the UPDATE will apply to all records in the table.
-- Practice: Employees
-- PRACTICE QUESTION #1
-- Rheta Raymen an employee of Carnival has asked to be transferred to a different dealership location. 
-- She is currently at dealership 751. She would like to work at dealership 20. Update her record to reflect her transfer.

        -- Deleting Data
        -- This chapter covers writing DELETE FROM statements and how they are affected by foreign key constraints.

        -- last minute decided not to purchase the vehicle. Help delete the Sales record with an invoice number of '7628231837'.
